     <h2>Hey there, glad you’re here!</h2>
     <p>I’m Isaiah — a passionate front-end developer and graphic designer with a drive for solving problems, building beautiful experiences, and helping small businesses thrive. With a few solid years of industry experience under my belt, I’m constantly learning, taking on new challenges, and collaborating with amazing teams to bring ideas to life.</p>
     <p>When I’m not designing or coding, you’ll find me outside doing what I love most — swimming, kayaking, running, or hiking through elevated terrain. I’m big on staying active and pushing my physical limits. Indoors, I keep that momentum going with roller skating and lifting at the gym. And when it’s time to slow down and recharge, I dive into one of my favorite hobbies: building LEGO sets and scale models.</p>
     <p>Beyond the screen and trail, I’ve always been fascinated by technology and space exploration. The idea of traveling beyond the stars and building sustainable life among the planets is a vision that constantly inspires me. I’m passionate about progress — not just in tech, but in helping people build better lives, stronger communities, and a future worth looking forward to.</p>
     <p>Thanks for stopping by — I’m excited to connect and see what we can build together.</p>
